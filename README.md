A **realistic tire wear system** for FiveM, adding dynamic tire degradation and a sleek NUI to enhance vehicle mechanics. Tires wear down based on speed, drivetrain, and terrain, and burst when durability hits zero. Features a repair command and server-side syncing for seamless gameplay.



## ✨ Features

- 🛞 **Dynamic Tire Wear**: Tires degrade based on driving speed, with configurable rates.
- ⚙️ **Drivetrain Effects**: Optional increased wear on driven wheels (FWD/RWD).
- 🌍 **Off-Road Wear**: Higher degradation on dirt, grass, or sand surfaces.
- 💥 **Tire Popping**: Tires burst at 0% durability, impacting vehicle handling.
- 📊 **NUI Display**:
  - Intact tires: Color-coded fill bars (🟢 green ≥70%, 🟠 orange 30-69%, 🔴 red <30%).
  - Popped tires: Flashing red/black boxes, no text.
- 🔧 **Repair Command**: Restore tires with `/fixmytyres` (configurable).
- 🌐 **Server Sync**: Persists tire durability across sessions.
